Gson Demo
---------

A program that demonstrates using Gson in a variety of ways, but mostly focused on writing adapters.

Logging
~~~~~~~

Logging is achieved using the SLF4J facade over Logback. The logging configuration is supplied in *config/logback.xml*. It can be overriden with a java system property, i.e. *-Dlogback.configurationFile=config/logback.xml*

== Demonstrated Concepts

* JsonDeserializer
* JsonSerializer
* Null Serialization
* TypeAdapter
* Versioning

== Additional Features

* SLF4J extension features without org.slf4j.ext
